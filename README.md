I am self-taught, although I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Systems Engineering at university. Despite being over 30 years old, I embarked on my university studies later in life. While I am often told that it is never too late, I remain uncertain. I have a strong passion for Front-end development and aspire to specialize in this area. Additionally, I am keen on expanding my knowledge in Back-end development to have a comprehensive understanding of both domains.
